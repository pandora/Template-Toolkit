Template::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about the Template Toolkit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for the Template Toolkit.
More accurately, it's a very thin placeholder for where the FAQ will
soon be.

=head2 General Questions

=over 4

=item Why is the sky blue?

Something to do with refraction.

=back

=head2 Language

=over 4

=item Why doesn't [% a = b IF c %] work as expected?

Because the parser interprets it as [% a = (b IF c) %].

Do this instead:

    [% SET a = b IF c %]

=back

=head2 Plugins

=over 4

=item Using the Table plugin, how do I order the data to go across rather than down?

Order the data into rows:

     Steve     Karen     Jeff
     Brooklyn  Nantucket Fairfax
     NY        MA        VA
 
    [% USE table(data, rows=3) %]
 
Then ask for each column
 
    [% FOREACH column = table.cols %]
 
And then print each item in the column going across the output rows
 
    [% FOREACH item = column %]
	<td>[% item %]</td>
    [% END %]

=back

=head2 Extending the Template Toolkit

=over 4

=item Can I serve templates from a database?

Short answer: yes, Chris Nandor has done this for Slash.  You need to 
subclass Template::Provider.  See the mailing list archives for further
info.

=back

=head2 Miscellaneous

=over 4

=item Can I have another cup of coffee?
