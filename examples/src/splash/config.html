[%  library = libs.splash
    section = 'config' ;
    WRAPPER page
%]

<p>
The splash/config file is used to specify various configuration values
for the Splash! library.  The most important item is 'splash.images'
which defines the URL prefix for the [% splash.bold %] images.  If 
this value is wrong, you'll notice that your interface elements don't
have smooth, rounded corners but empty, square chunks of broken image
links. 
</p>

</p>
Afer that, everything is pretty much a matter of personal taste.  You
can change the default colours but beware that some colours don't have
the requisite images yet, so check the images directory first and see
what's available.  I'll be adding more colours just as soon as I get a
round tuit.  I'll also try to remember to stick the Photoshop source
file up on the <a href="[% splash.homepage %]">web site</a> for anyone
who wants to help out with making image files.  A GIMP Script-Fu 
script would be really nice to automate this if anyone has the 
requisite skills and a spare moment...  I've got a GIMP book I'm 
still trying to find time to read... :-)
</p>

<p>
If you want to make changes without modifying the main configuration
file then you can always PROCESS the splash/config file and then
change values afterwards.  So you might have your own config file
(automatically processed as a PRE_PROCESS template, for example) which
does something like this:
</p>

[% TAGS star %]
[* WRAPPER source -*]
[% PROCESS splash/config;
   splash.images       = '/~abw/tt2/splash/images'
   splash.select.col   = 'leaf'
   splash.unselect.col = 'bud'
%]
[*- END *]
[* TAGS tt2 *]

<p>
Here's what your splash/config file currently looks like:
</p>

[%  INSERT splash/config WRAPPER source %]

[% END %]
