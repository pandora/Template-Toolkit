<p>
The splash/button template provides one of the fundamental components
of the [% splash.bold %] library.  A button is a coloured box with rounded
corners which can be used as a menu button, title bar, enclosing panel, and 
in various other ways as shown in the examples below.
</p>

<p>
The splash/bar template is a slight variation on this, having either
the top or bottom half rounded and the other square.  The examples
towards the end of this page show how they can be used in conjunction
with the splash/panel element to create panels with rounded header or
footer bars.
