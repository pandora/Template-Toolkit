<p>
[% splash.bold %] is a library of templates which can be used to build
fancy looking HTML pages from a number of simple but powerful
components and fundamental elements.  It is effectively an HTML widget
set which can be used to greatly simplify the process of building user
interfaces for web document systems and applications.
</p>

<p>
[% splash.bold %] is built on top of the HTML library.  It defines
some basic colour schemes (currently limited to only a few colours,
but that's likely to change) and provides some very small (8x8 pixels,
&lt; 1k) and simple graphics for creating rounded corners in these
various colours.  With nothing else but regular HTML we can build some
very attractive buttons, tabs, panels and other widgets which can be
used to brighten up any web page.

<p>
[% splash.bold %] was chosen as a name for the libary as a
tip-of-the-hat to Slashdot whose web site ([% PROCESS html/link
link="http://slashdot.org/" %] ) contains many nice user interface
components such as these.  I was inspired by their look and allowed
myself to draw influence from them as well as a number of other
places.  The <a href="http://slashcode.org/">Slashcode</a> engine
which runs Slashdot has recently been rewritten (by <a
href="mailto:pudge@pobox.com">Chris Nandor</a>) to use the Template
Toolkit for generating interface elements, so we like the guys at
Slashdot and (hopefully) they like us, too.  :-)

<p>
This is the first public release of [% splash.bold %] and should be
considered as alpha quality code.  Everything is subject to change and
at this stage, I can make no guarantees of "correctness" about any of
the generated HTML.  My HTML skills aren't what they used to be and
I'm not very up-to-date with all the latest browser compatability
issues.  Having said that, I've tried to use vanilla HTML wherever
possible and tried to keep everything as simple, small and correct as
I can.  If you have an comments, suggestions, corrections, additions,
or any other contributions to make then please do <a
href="mailto:abw@kfs.org">get in touch</a>.  There are plenty more
widgets waiting to be written.  Feel free to write them.
</p>

<p>
A final word of warning - don't go overboard in using these widgets.
Use them sparingly, or rather, use them <i>appropriately</i>.  There
is more to good design than a fancy paintbrush and you <i>can</i> have
too much of a Good Thing.  Remember that the most important thing on
any web page is the content.  Use these widgets as an enhancement for
your content, not a replacement.
