=head1 BUGS

See the separate F<TODO> file for details of known bugs, limitations
and planned features.  The F<Changes> file details visible changes 
in the toolkit between public versions.  The definition of 'visible'
is of course entirely dependent on how hard you're looking.

If you do find something that looks or acts like a bug, then please 
report it along with a I<short> example of what doesn't work as 
advertised and as much I<relevant> detail as you can give about how it
manifested itself.  The best way to report a bug is to send a 
short test file that illustrates the problem.  You can use F<t/skel.t>
as a skeleton test file.

Example:

    use lib qw( . ./t ../lib );
    use Template;
    require 'texpect.pl';

    test_expect(\*DATA);

    __DATA__
    -- test --
    [% a = 10 %]
    [% explode(a) %]
    -- expect --
    Big Bang!

If you are able to find and fix the bug, and feel inclined to do so, 
then patches are most welcome of all, especially when prepared by
C<diff -u>.

The Template Toolkit is an Open Source project and you are encouraged to 
contribute ideas, suggestions and code.  The templates mailing list is 
currently the focal point for discussion on these matters.  Alternatively,
you can email the author directly.

To join the mailing list, send email to E<lt>majordomo@cre.canon.co.ukE<gt>
containing the text "subscribe templates".  

To email the author directly, send email to E<lt>abw@cre.canon.co.ukE<gt>.  

If you don't know how to do that then you are probably beyond helping.
