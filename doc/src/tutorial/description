=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tutorial document provides a introduction to the Template Toolkit
and demonstrates some of the typical ways it may be used.  It covers
the generation of static pages from templates using the F<tpage> and
F<ttree> scripts and then goes on to show dynamic content generation 
using CGI scripts and Apache/mod_perl handlers.

Various features of the Template Toolkit are introduced and described 
briefly and explained by use of example.  For a complete reference and
guide to the template directives, features and options, consult the 
F<Template> documentation.  e.g.
