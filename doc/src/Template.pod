# DESCRIPTION
#   This is the main documentation for the Template module and the 
#   Template Toolkit as a whole.  It is constructed automatically 
#   during the 'make dist' process from the document fragments in 
#   the doc/src distribution sub-directory.  
#
#   **************************** IMPORTANT ****************************
#     Any changes to this document should be made to the files in the 
#     doc/src directory and not the lib/Template.pod file itself.
