=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Template Toolkit was derived in part from ideas and techniques
developed in the Text::MetaText module.  This itself was the public
manifestation of an earlier template processing system I developed
while working at Peritas Ltd. (http://www.knowledgepool.com/).

The Template Toolkit was developed more recently at Canon Research
Centre Europe Ltd. as part of an ongoing research theme into
Web-related publishing and content generation.  Other tools are in
development to compliment the Template Toolkit.

Many people have contributed ideas, inspiration, fixes and features to
both Text::MetaText and the Template Toolkit and they all deserve credit
for having improved the end product in some way and their efforts
continue to be very much appreciated.  In particular, Simon Matthews
E<lt>sam@knowledegpool.comE<gt>, aka "SAM", deserves special mention
(and wins many beer tokens) for his continued effort and interest over
a number of years.  Please let me know if you think anyone is missing 
from this list.
