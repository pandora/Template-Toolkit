=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Template Toolkit was derived in part from ideas and techniques
developed in the Text::MetaText module.  This itself was the public
manifestation of an earlier template processing system I developed
while working at Peritas Ltd. (http://www.knowledgepool.com/).

The Template Toolkit was developed more recently at Canon Research
Centre Europe Ltd. as part of an ongoing research theme into
Web-related publishing and content generation.  Other tools are in
development to compliment the Template Toolkit.

Many people have contributed ideas, inspiration, bug reports and fixes
to Text::MetaText and the Template Toolkit, but none more so than
Simon Matthews E<lt>sam@knowledegpool.comE<gt>, aka "SAM".  He
deserves special mention (and wins many beer tokens) for his continued
effort and interest over a number of years.
