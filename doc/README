#========================================================================

This directory contains the template 'source' for the toolkit
documentation.  The README file in the main distribution directory is
created from ./src/README.pod, along with ./src/Template.pod which
ends up in ../lib.  These files are constructed by the 'bin/mkdoc'
scripts which is called from the Makefile.PL in the main distribution
directory.
